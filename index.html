<tr> <td>
<p> My family adopted my dog, Bailey, in December of 2015. We rescued her from the Atlanta Humane Society. Her birthday is October 23 and she is currently three years old. While they told us she was a Lab-Spaniel mix, we are unsure what type of dog breed she is since she was rescued. 
</p>
<p> Bailey's favorite things to do are walk and play fetch. She is a very athletic dog, so she loves walking and running after the balls. My mom and I walk her around our neighborhood every morning. Since we have been doing this for her whole life, she has gotten to know her surroundings very well, so we don't have to walk her on a leash. On the trail that we take her on, we see the same people, which has given Bailey dog friends. Her best friend's name is Murphy. 
</p>
<p> Bailey is also a very smart dog. She actually knows my whole family's names. When someone says "Maggie is home," she knows exactly what that means. Bailey also loves to swim, but not until she was 2 years old. She used to be extremely scared of water until my dad threw her in the water to overcome her fear. Bailey is such a great dog and I could not imagine my life without her. She truly is a best friend to my whole family!

I was able to teach her tricks by using treats. She loves them so much, and I'm sure your dog would too! The link to buy treats is: <a href="https://www.milkbone.com/products/original-biscuits/medium"> Milkbone Dog Treats </a>
